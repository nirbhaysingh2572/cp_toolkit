## About

Write 2–4 sentences describing the project: the problem it solves, the target audience, and any high-level design decisions. Example:

> **MyProject** is a lightweight CLI/GUI tool that helps students manage personal study schedules. Built for readability and fast iteration.

## Features

* Core feature 1 (short)
* Core feature 2 (short)
* Nice-to-have feature 3

Add a short sentence for each feature where helpful.

## Tech Stack

List the main technologies so readers know what to expect.

* Language: JavaScript / TypeScript / C++ / Python
* Framework: React / Node.js / Express / Qt
* Database (if any): SQLite / PostgreSQL / MongoDB
* Tooling: Webpack / Vite / CMake / Make

## Prerequisites

What must be installed before setup. Be explicit with versions where important.

* Node.js >= 18 and npm / pnpm / yarn (if JS)
* C++ compiler (g++ / clang) and CMake >= 3.20 (if C++)
* Docker (optional)
* Any environment variables listed in [Configuration](#configuration)

## Installation

Provide step-by-step commands that someone can copy-paste. Use subsections for different stacks if needed.

### For a JavaScript / React project

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# install dependencies
npm install          # or yarn install / pnpm install

# start dev server
npm run dev          # or npm start
```

### For a C++ project (CMake)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
# run executable
./your_executable
```

Add any platform-specific notes (Windows, macOS, Linux) if required.

## Configuration

Explain environment variables or configuration files. Provide an example `.env.example` content.

```
# .env.example
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname
NODE_ENV=development
```

Tell users to copy `.env.example` → `.env` and edit values.

## Usage

Short examples showing how to run the project or call important commands / endpoints.

```bash
# run in production
npm run build
npm run start

# run a single script / command
npm run migrate
```

If your project exposes an API, add example curl calls or Postman examples:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/login -d '{"user":"me","pass":"sec"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

## Running Tests

Explain how to run unit / integration tests.

```bash
# JS
npm test

# C++ (using CTest)
ctest --output-on-failure
```

## Linting & Formatting

Commands and recommended editors / extensions.

```bash
# lint
npm run lint
# format
npm run format
```

Recommend EditorConfig, Prettier, ESLint or clang-format.

## Folder Structure

Give a quick map of the important folders and files.

```
├── src/                # source code
│   ├── components/     # UI components
│   └── index.js
├── public/             # static files
├── tests/              # test suites
├── build/              # build output
└── README.md
```

## How to Contribute

Explain expected workflow (fork → branch → PR), coding standards, commit message format, and how to run tests locally.

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. Make changes and add tests
4. Commit with a clear message
5. Push and open a Pull Request

Optionally include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` link.

## Troubleshooting

Common problems and fixes.

* **Problem:** `Cannot connect to DB` — **Fix:** make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set and database is running.
* **Problem:** `node: command not found` — **Fix:** install Node.js and ensure it’s in your PATH.

## FAQ

Add brief Q/A for common questions.

**Q:** Does this work on Windows?
**A:** Yes — add any caveats.

## Screenshots / Demo

Show quick screenshots or GIFs (path to `/docs` or `/screenshots`). Example Markdown for adding an image:

```markdown
![homepage screenshot](./screenshots/homepage.png)
```

## CI / CD

Describe how CI runs (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), and how to deploy.

```yaml
# example: .github/workflows/ci.yml
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

## Contact

Maintainer name — email / Twitter / GitHub

If you want me to help write the exact content for any section, tell me:

* Project name
* Short 1–2 sentence description
* Stack (React, Node, C++, etc.)
* Setup commands you use locally (install/start/build/test)

I can then customize this README into a ready-to-use file.
